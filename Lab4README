1). For this project, I have chosen to work within the inventory management domain. 
    This system will be designed to help businesses track and manage their stock of 
    products or resources. The primary purpose of the system is to ensure that an 
    organization has accurate and up-to-date information about its inventory levels,    
    reducing the chances of stock shortages or overstocking. It will enable users to 
    monitor product availability, track the addition of new stock, update product 
    information, and manage different types of inventory. I chose this domain because 
    inventory management is a crucial aspect of many businesses, and an efficient system 
    can significantly streamline operations, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce 
    operational costs. Additionally, the inventory management system provides a practical 
    and real-world application of using JPA (Java Persistence API) in NetBeans, 
    allowing me to better understand how to manage data persistence in business systems.

2). Although only one entity (such as Inventory) is required for Lab 4, there are several 
    other entities that could exist within an inventory management system. For example, 
    an Order entity could be used to track purchases or requests for products from inventory. 
    Similarly, a Supplier entity could be created to store information about vendors who 
    provide stock to the company, including details like supplier contact information and 
    delivery schedules. Additionally, a Customer entity could represent clients who are 
    purchasing products, and this would be linked to orders. These entities would interact 
    with one another in various ways. For example, an Order could be linked to both a 
    Customer (who placed the order) and the specific Inventory items that are being requested. 
    A Supplier would relate to the Inventory, as they provide the goods stocked in the 
    inventory. Together, these entities create a system that not only tracks the 
    quantity of products in stock but also manages the entire workflow from suppliers to 
    customers.
