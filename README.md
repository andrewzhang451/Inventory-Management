3). The difficulty I had with this assignment was debugging a lot of my syntax errors through out the lab that cause me to pause VERY frequently with every testing. I did learn a lot about 
security authenitcation. The going back and forth between some of the files does feel a bit frustrating but it helps me understand why each of the step is important. 
I had some naming issues as well which ive decided to make a comment for so I do not have to go back and change a lot.
